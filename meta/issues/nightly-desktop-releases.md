# Publish unsigned nightly desktop builds

## Summary

Build native desktop artifacts on every push to `main` and publish them to a
rolling GitHub prerelease named `nightly`, without representing these unsigned
artifacts as production releases.

## Requirements

- Build on native GitHub runners for Linux x64, Windows x64, and macOS arm64.
- Bundle the matching compiled daemon, static frontend, and Delta Chat helper in
  every artifact.
- Produce Flatpak and AppImage variants for Linux, an installer executable for
  Windows, and a DMG for macOS.
- Publish versioned artifact names and SHA-256 checksums to a rolling `nightly`
  GitHub prerelease after all platform builds succeed.
- Keep the workflow free of signing/notarization credentials; clearly label the
  outputs as unsigned development builds.
- Explain when to use each artifact, how to install or run it, its architecture
  and sandbox/update limitations, and where it stores persistent application
  data.

## Acceptance Criteria

- A push to `main` runs checks/builds and uploads one `.flatpak`, one `.AppImage`,
  one `.exe`, and one `.dmg` plus checksums to the `nightly` prerelease.
- Each native job verifies that the expected staged helper and packaged output
  exist before upload.
- Pull requests do not publish releases, and concurrent pushes cannot mix
  artifacts from different commits.
- The production packaging/signing issue remains open.

## Notes

- Child slice of `desktop-platform-packaging.md`; signing, notarization, hardened
  fuses, updates, and installed-artifact acceptance remain there.
- Native CI run `29646214311` verified the Flatpak, AppImage packaged smoke,
  Windows installer, final DMG, checksums, and rolling prerelease publication.
  The expanded release guidance was published with the same successful run.
