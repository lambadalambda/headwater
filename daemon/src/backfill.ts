/**
 * Thread auto-backfill (design-sketch #3, meta/issues/thread-auto-backfill.md):
 * the auto-fetch LOOP that heals dangling reply/boost/root refs by asking the
 * peer who showed them to us. On ingest of a message whose ref doesn't resolve
 * (locally or as a held envelope), we enqueue `(peer=sender, uuid)`; per-peer
 * batches flush into ONE `envelope-request` control DM (60 msgs/min relay budget
 * → batching is mandatory), the peer answers with an `envelope-bundle`, and the
 * new held items may themselves dangle → next round, bounded.
 *
 * The scheduling policy (which refs are eligible under backoff, how to chunk a
 * peer's pending set into request-sized batches) is PURE and unit-tested here;
 * the closure below wires it to an injected clock + send callback + the store's
 * negative-cache, so nothing in this file touches the transport or real time.
 *
 * CRITICAL suppression: this module NEVER creates notifications or streaming
 * events, and held envelopes it stores NEVER enter timelines — they exist only
 * for thread views + status fetch (other people's backfilled history). Enforced
 * structurally: the receive path calls `store.addHeldEnvelope` (which no
 * notification/stream code path reads) and nothing else.

 * A queued backfill target: the uuid we need, the peer (a met contact) to ask,

 *
 * `peerContactId` is the peer's MESSAGE-DERIVED DC contact id (`msg.fromId` of
 * the message that surfaced the dangling ref, or of the bundle DM for transitive
 * refs). This — not the addr — is what the request DM is SENT to: DC core 2.x
 * separates KEY-contacts (securejoin/message-derived, e2ee-capable) from
 * ADDRESS-contacts (`createContact`/addr lookup, keyless), and resolving a peer
 * BY ADDRESS lands on the keyless row ("e2e encryption unavailable") even when
 * the key-contact exists. Every working DM send in this codebase targets a

 *  - `maxRequestsPerMinute` (4): the global rate cap on request DMs — a small
 *    slice of the 60/min budget, leaving the rest for the user.
 *  - `flushDelayMs` (2000): per-peer batching window; refs that arrive close
 *    together coalesce into ONE request rather than one DM each.
 *  - `maxAttempts` (5): give up on a ref after this many request DMs (peers go
 *    offline; accounts expire at 90 days) so a dead ref never loops forever.
 *  - `backoffBaseMs` (60_000) + `backoffFactor` (4): exponential backoff between
 *    attempts on the SAME ref — 1m, 4m, 16m, 64m — so a temporarily-unreachable
 *    peer is retried without hammering.
 *  - `maxRounds` (10): transitive-fill depth bound per peer chain, so a
 *    pathological reply chain (or a peer feeding us endless new dangling refs)
 *    can't loop unboundedly; combined with the global rate cap this is belt+braces.
 *  - `maxRefsPerRequest`: the per-DM batch cap (envelope.ts).
