/**
 * Store JSON schema version. Bumped when the *derivable* index shape changes so
 * a daemon restart can re-index cleanly without touching the Delta Chat
 * databases (see ../meta/issues/canonical-mid-unification.md migration section):
 * on load with an older/missing version, the derived indices are dropped and
 * the startup backfill re-derives them (now with canonical-mid aliasing), while
 * notifications + dedupe keys + pending requests are preserved so re-derivation
 * can never duplicate-notify. Version 1 introduced canonical-mid aliasing.
 * Version 2 changed `replyChildren` values from child msgIds to child CANONICAL
 * mids (so a reply's DM copy and feed copy collapse to one child edge, and a
 * non-follower's DM-only reply renders in the thread — see
 * ../meta/issues/non-follower-thread-rendering.md); the `migrate` drop covers
 * `replyChildren`, so a v1 store re-indexes into the new value shape on restart.
 * Version 3 generalized historical text-twin aliasing from SELF-only to
 * per-author: a v2 re-index registered BOTH copies of another author's
 * pre-canonical (marker-less) reply as children — double-rendered threads and
 * inflated replies_count on follower nodes — so already-migrated v2 stores
 * must re-index once more with the generalized aliasing.
 * Version 4 introduced the POST-KEY keyspace (wire convention v1 — author-minted
 * logical-post UUIDs, see ../DEVLOG.md): every derived index is now keyed by
 * `postKey(msg) = parsed uuid ?? canonicalize(mid)`, and a new uuid->msgId index
 * (preferring feed copies) backs `resolveKey`. The `migrate` drop covers the new
 * uuid index too, so a v3 store re-indexes into the post-key shape on restart.
 * Version 5 introduced wire convention v2 (JSON envelopes, see ../DEVLOG.md +
 * docs/decisions.md 0001): every ingest now parses through `parseWire`/
 * `parseWireUuid` (v2 envelope first, then the v0/v1 markers for existing
 * histories), so a re-index parses mixed-era data consistently. The post-key
 * keyspace is unchanged conceptually — a v2 message's `uuid` field feeds
 * `postKey` exactly as the v1 `⚑` marker did — so dedupe keys are continuous:
 * legacy messages still derive the same `type:addr:mid[:emoji]` keys (they
 * carry no uuid, so `postKey` falls back to the canonical mid, as before).
