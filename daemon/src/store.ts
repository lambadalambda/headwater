 * the startup backfill re-derives them (now with canonical-mid aliasing), while
 * notifications + dedupe keys + pending requests are preserved so re-derivation
 * can never duplicate-notify. Version 1 introduced canonical-mid aliasing.
 * Version 2 changed `replyChildren` values from child msgIds to child CANONICAL
 * mids (so a reply's DM copy and feed copy collapse to one child edge, and a
 * non-follower's DM-only reply renders in the thread — see
 * ../meta/issues/non-follower-thread-rendering.md); the `migrate` drop covers
 * `replyChildren`, so a v1 store re-indexes into the new value shape on restart.
 * Version 3 generalized historical text-twin aliasing from SELF-only to
 * per-author: a v2 re-index registered BOTH copies of another author's
 * pre-canonical (marker-less) reply as children — double-rendered threads and
 * inflated replies_count on follower nodes — so already-migrated v2 stores
