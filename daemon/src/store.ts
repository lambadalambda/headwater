/**
 * Store JSON schema version. Bumped when the *derivable* index shape changes so
 * a daemon restart can re-index cleanly without touching the Delta Chat
 * databases (see ../meta/issues/canonical-mid-unification.md migration section):
 * on load with an older/missing version, the derived indices are dropped and
 * the startup backfill re-derives them (now with canonical-mid aliasing), while
 * notifications + dedupe keys + pending requests are preserved so re-derivation
 * can never duplicate-notify. Version 1 introduced canonical-mid aliasing.
 * Version 2 changed `replyChildren` values from child msgIds to child CANONICAL
 * mids (so a reply's DM copy and feed copy collapse to one child edge, and a
 * non-follower's DM-only reply renders in the thread — see
 * ../meta/issues/non-follower-thread-rendering.md); the `migrate` drop covers
 * `replyChildren`, so a v1 store re-indexes into the new value shape on restart.
 * Version 3 generalized historical text-twin aliasing from SELF-only to
 * per-author: a v2 re-index registered BOTH copies of another author's
 * pre-canonical (marker-less) reply as children — double-rendered threads and
 * inflated replies_count on follower nodes — so already-migrated v2 stores
 * must re-index once more with the generalized aliasing.
 * Version 4 introduced the POST-KEY keyspace (wire convention v1 — author-minted
 * logical-post UUIDs, see ../DEVLOG.md): every derived index is now keyed by
 * `postKey(msg) = parsed uuid ?? canonicalize(mid)`, and a new uuid->msgId index
 * (preferring feed copies) backs `resolveKey`. The `migrate` drop covers the new
 * uuid index too, so a v3 store re-indexes into the post-key shape on restart.
 * Version 5 introduced wire convention v2 (JSON envelopes, see ../DEVLOG.md +
 * docs/decisions.md 0001): every ingest now parses through `parseWire`/
 * `parseWireUuid` (v2 envelope first, then the v0/v1 markers for existing
 * histories), so a re-index parses mixed-era data consistently. The post-key
 * keyspace is unchanged conceptually — a v2 message's `uuid` field feeds
 * `postKey` exactly as the v1 `⚑` marker did — so dedupe keys are continuous:
 * legacy messages still derive the same `type:addr:mid[:emoji]` keys (they
 * carry no uuid, so `postKey` falls back to the canonical mid, as before).
 * Version 6 introduced thread auto-backfill state (see
 * ../meta/issues/thread-auto-backfill.md): a HELD-ENVELOPE section (verified
 * foreign envelopes not backed by a local DC message, keyed by post uuid) plus a
 * backfill ATTEMPT-STATE section (negative cache: per-ref attempt count +
 * last-attempt ts for exponential backoff). BOTH are trust/cache roots, NOT
 * derivable indices — like notifications/pinnedKeys they SURVIVE a `migrate`
 * re-index (a held envelope came from a peer bundle we cannot re-derive from a
 * local sweep; the attempt state records network history a sweep cannot know).
 * They are additive fields (the `{...emptyData(), ...raw}` load defaults them to
 * `{}` for pre-v6 stores), so an existing v5 store gains them on load without
 * losing anything; the version bump itself is what forces the derived-index
 * re-index that seeds the backfill queue from pre-existing dangling refs.
 * Version 7 introduced thread-subscription state (see
 * ../meta/issues/thread-subscribe.md): `hostedThreads` (root uuid -> the
 * broadcast chatId we host that thread's channel on, host side) and
 * `threadSubscriptions` (root uuid -> the chatId we joined for a thread we
 * subscribe to, subscriber side). BOTH are non-derivable roots — a hosted
 * channel's chatId and a subscribed channel's chatId cannot be reconstructed
 * from a message sweep (they name DC chats created/joined out-of-band) — so,
 * like pins/held envelopes, they SURVIVE a `migrate` re-index. Additive fields,
 * defaulted to `{}` for pre-v7 stores.
 * Version 8 carries NO shape change: it forces the derived-index re-index
 * after the trailing-junk-tolerant `parseEnvelope` fix. Messages that arrived
 * while DC core's transient download placeholder was appended to their text
 * (`{...} [Image – 137.37 KiB]`) were mis-keyed under their canonical MID
 * instead of their uuid (the uuid parse failed); the persisted text is clean,
 * so re-indexing with the tolerant parser re-keys them and their reaction
 * tallies line up again.
