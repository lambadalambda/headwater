/**
 * Post attestations (design-sketch #6, decision 0002): per-account ed25519
 * signing so republished content (boost embeds; thread republication later) is
 * offline-verifiable by anyone holding the author's public key. A republisher
 * can OMIT content (reply control) but can never ALTER or FABRICATE it.
 *
 * The signature covers a CANONICAL PAYLOAD reconstructed from the envelope's
 * fields — never the raw JSON string — so any re-serialization (key order,
 * whitespace, added-then-ignored fields) can never break verification. The
 * format is fixed-order, LENGTH-PREFIXED per field, and version-prefixed so it
 * can evolve without silently mismatching old signatures. Length-prefixing
 * (rather than a bare separator) makes each field self-delimiting: `text` and
 * `refToken` are attacker-controlled JSON strings that may contain ANY byte
 * (including NUL), so a separator-joined payload would be ambiguous — two
 * different field tuples could concatenate to identical bytes, letting one
 * signature verify two different envelopes.
 *
 * Everything here is pure/injectable where practical: `canonicalPayload`,
 * `verify`, and `sha256File` take their inputs explicitly; only key material is
 * stateful, and its storage path is injected exactly like the store path is.
 * The PRIVATE key is NEVER logged and never leaves this module.
