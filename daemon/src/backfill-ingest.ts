/**
 * Thread auto-backfill — the INGEST-side wiring (design-sketch #3,
 * meta/issues/thread-auto-backfill.md): the three things that happen when
 * messages flow through the daemon's ingest hook, factored out of main.ts so
 * they're unit-testable against a fake transport + a plain store + a fake
 * backfiller:
 *
 *  1. DANGLING DETECTION — on any content message, enqueue its unresolved
 *     uuid refs `(peer=sender, uuid)` for the auto-fetch loop.
 *  2. SERVE — on an `envelope-request` DIRECT DM (never one relayed inside a
 *     bundle), reply with a size-chunked bundle of the SIGNED envelopes we hold
 *     for the requested uuids (verbatim; unsigned/legacy omitted). Rate-limited
 *     per peer.
 *  3. BUNDLE RECEIPT — on an `envelope-bundle` DM, validate + store each item as
 *     a HELD envelope (no overwrite of a local/held resolution), mark resolved,
 *     and re-run dangling detection on the new items (transitive fill).
 *
 * CRITICAL suppression (issue): NONE of these create notifications or streaming
 * events, and held envelopes NEVER enter timelines. Enforced structurally —
 * this module only calls `store.addHeldEnvelope` / the backfiller / the bundle
 * send, none of which touch the notification store, the streaming hub, or the
 * timeline read path. A caller must invoke `handleBackfillControlDm` BEFORE (or
 * instead of) any notification-deriving pass for these control types (they carry
 * no user-facing interaction), and must skip streaming for them.
