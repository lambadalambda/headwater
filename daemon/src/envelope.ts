 * deltanet wire convention v2 (see ../DEVLOG.md "wire convention v2 — JSON
 * envelope" + docs/decisions.md 0001/0002). The ENTIRE message body is a single
 * JSON object — a versioned envelope with an explicit `type`, the human text as
 * a *field*, refs/uuids/extensions as fields. This kills the in-band ambiguity
 * of the v0/v1 text markers (user content can no longer collide with protocol
 * grammar) and lifts the one-glyph-per-verb ceiling.
 *
 * These are pure functions: no transport, no store, just structured value <->
 * JSON string. The v0/v1 marker parsers (./protocol.ts) remain READ-SIDE for
 * existing histories; we NEVER emit them again.
 *
 * Schema discipline (decision 0001): the `dn` version field gates parsing
 * (strict `dn === 2`), unknown fields MUST be ignored (forward-compat), and
 * field names are NEVER repurposed. `pubkey`/`sig`/`ts`/`orig`/`media.sha256`
 * are the post-attestation fields (design-sketch #6, decision 0002): every
 * content envelope (post/reply/boost) is signed with a per-account ed25519 key
 * (see ./attest.ts) and boosts embed the boosted post's complete signed
 * envelope as `orig` (+ re-attached media, verified by `media.sha256`).
