 *
 * - incoming (non-SELF) reply targeting an own mid -> mention notification.
 * - incoming (non-SELF) boost targeting an own mid -> reblog notification.
 * - incoming (non-SELF) reaction/unreaction -> apply/retract in the
 *   reaction store; if the reacted-to mid is our own, also notify
 *   (favourite for ❤, pleroma:emoji_reaction otherwise).
 * - SELF reaction/unreaction control DMs re-derive OUR OWN tally (apply/retract
 *   with `ownAddr`), so a re-index (migration) restores reactions we made —
 *   the endpoints only ever applied them directly, so without this a fresh
 *   store loses them (see ../meta/issues/non-follower-thread-rendering.md).
 *   `ownAddr` is threaded in from the caller (main.ts/server/integration
 *   ingest) since a SELF message's `sender.address` is not reliably our own
 *   canonical address. Requires `ownAddr` to be present; when it's undefined
 *   (a caller that can't know it yet) SELF derivation is skipped.
 * - SELF messages otherwise produce NO notifications and NO reaction side
 *   effects here (and never a follow-back action). The endpoints' direct-apply
 *   of our own reactions stays (idempotent set-add, so a later re-derive is a
 *   no-op).
 *
 * Ordering caveat for the SELF reaction re-derivation: within one chat,
 * `getMessageIds` is chronological, so a react then a later unreact of the same
 * mid replay in order and the retract wins; across chats, ordering is
 * irrelevant since distinct chats hold reactions for distinct mids.
 *
 * Returns the notifications actually created (i.e. not dedupe no-ops) —
 * `Store.addNotification` already reports this per-call via its `| null`
 * return, so this just collects the non-null results. Live ingestion
 * (`main.ts`) uses this to broadcast exactly the newly-derived notifications
 * over the streaming hub without a separate before/after diff against
 * `listNotifications`. SELF re-derivation never produces notifications, so it
 * doesn't affect the return value.
