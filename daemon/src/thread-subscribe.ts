/**
 * Thread subscribe — per-thread broadcast channel hosted by the root author
 * (design-sketch #3, layers 2–3; meta/issues/thread-subscribe.md). The INGEST-
 * side wiring + pure helpers, factored out of main.ts so the whole surface is
 * unit-testable against a fake transport + a plain store, mirroring
 * backfill-ingest.ts.
 *
 * Three flows the daemon runs at ingest time:
 *
 *  1. HOST — a scoped invite-request DM (`{type:'invite-request',scope:{thread}}`)
 *     for a thread WE hold: lazily create a per-thread broadcast channel (once),
 *     auto-grant by DMing back a scoped invite-grant, then DM the thread-so-far
 *     as envelope-bundle(s) (same format + signed-only rule as backfill; a
 *     requester is 1:1-reachable by construction — their request DM just arrived,
 *     so we reply via `msg.fromId`). Public-thread semantics: auto-grant.
 *
 *  2. REPUBLISH — a freshly-ingested reply whose SIGNED `root` names a hosted
 *     thread: wrap the reply's SIGNED envelope VERBATIM in an envelope-bundle and
 *     post it into the thread channel. Never alter/fabricate (0002); the host MAY
 *     omit (reply control = moderation). Dedupe: never republish the same uuid
 *     twice.
 *
 *  3. SUBSCRIBE — a scoped invite-grant DM we SOLICITED: securejoin the granted
 *     channel and record it as a THREAD SUBSCRIPTION (not a followed feed — it
 *     must not surface in following()/home). Bundles arriving on a subscribed
 *     thread channel are then admitted through the EXISTING backfill bundle
 *     ingest (held envelopes, render-time verify, no TOFU pins).
 *
 * CRITICAL suppression (issue): none of these create notifications or streaming
 * events, and held envelopes from a thread channel NEVER enter timelines — the
 * thread view (context endpoint) is where subscribed content appears. Enforced
 * structurally: this module only touches the store's thread maps + held state +
 * the backfiller, never the notification store / streaming hub / timeline read.
