# deltanet docs

- [decisions.md](decisions.md) — standing design decisions (0001: hard cut
  from vanilla Delta Chat compatibility; wire v2 = JSON bodies).

- [substrate-audit.md](substrate-audit.md) — hard facts about chatmail
  relays + Delta Chat core (limits, retention, encryption model, contact
  model), source-verified 2026-07-06 against relay@filtermail-v0.7.4 and
  core@v2.53.0.
- [federation-comparison.md](federation-comparison.md) — the exploration:
  chatmail federation vs the fediverse — matches, clashes, UX
  consequences, and what deltanet can do that ActivityPub can't.

- [design-sketches.md](design-sketches.md) — unscheduled design ideas: channel-based
  visibility tiers + directory node, verifiable reaction receipts,
  subscribable threads (root-author-as-host).

Design history and day-by-day findings live in the repo-root DEVLOG.md;
the wire convention itself is documented there (v0 markers → v1 post
UUIDs).
