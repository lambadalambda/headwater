# Design sketches (not scheduled)

Ideas explored 2026-07-07, downstream of the
[federation comparison](federation-comparison.md). None scheduled; captured
so the reasoning isn't lost. Common pattern across all three: **the party
that already has the data becomes a publisher** — the substrate's native
substitute for the fediverse's global fetchability.

## 1. Visibility tiers via multiple channels (not multiple accounts)

One account can own many broadcast channels; invites are per-channel and
multi-use (with withdraw/revive support in core). So:

- **public channel** — invite auto-granted to anyone (existing
  invite-request convention), link published in bio/QR/directory.
- **locked channel** — approval-gated grants (locked-mode hook).
- Mastodon visibility dropdown maps natively: `public` → public channel,
  `private` → locked channel. Today the selector is decorative; this makes
  it real. Do NOT model this as two accounts: splits identity, doubles key
  management, forces followers to manage two contacts.

Discovery ("announce the invite somewhere") = a **directory node**: a
well-known deltanet account that auto-grants follows, accepts listing
submissions as DMs (profile card + public-channel invite), republishes the
directory as a feed — and, being an ordinary server, can also serve an
HTTPS listing site (web presence without violating the relay's
no-cleartext rule).

## 2. Verifiable reaction gossip: portable receipts

Reaction gossip (author publishes tally digests to followers) is trusted
by default — the author could lie. Upgrade: make each reaction DM a
self-contained **signed assertion** ("addr X reacts ❤ to u:<uuid>"); the
author's digest then republishes receipts, not bare counts. Followers who
hold the reactor's key (Autocrypt gossip spreads keys anyway) verify
offline. Large counts: count + sampled receipts + rest on demand.
Fallback for unverifiable receipts: automated challenge-response
(`⁇ attest u:<uuid> ❤` → signed confirm/deny from the reactor's daemon)
— trust by default, verify when curious.

Honest limit: receipts prevent **author forgery**, not **sybil
inflation** — instant free signup means a liar can mint real accounts
with real signatures. Different layer, not solvable here.

## 3. Subscribable threads: root author as thread host

The root author's node already receives every reply (reply DM copies).
Make it publish:

- Lazy **thread channel** (broadcast owned by root author) created on
  first subscriber.
- Subscribe = scoped invite-request (`⇋ invite-request thread:u:<uuid>`),
  auto-granted.
- Host republishes every reply it receives, boost-style embed + original
  `⚑` uuid (+ signed receipt for provenance once sketch 2 exists).

Properties: complete threads for subscribers even when participants are
mutual strangers (also retroactively fixes third-party reply-visibility
gaps); **reply control** for the root author (declining to republish =
thread moderation the fediverse can't cleanly do). Wart: the 10-message
join backfill — host should send a "thread so far" bundle to new
subscribers; long-term, thread-as-webxdc gives full update-replay history
and is probably webxdc's first natural use here.

## 4. Expanding the join backfill (10 → N)

The 10-message backfill lives in CORE on the channel owner's device
(`resend_last_msgs()`, `N_MSGS_TO_NEW_BROADCAST_MEMBER` in constants.rs),
not on the relay — i.e. inside our own daemon process. Expansion paths,
ranked: (1) upstream a config knob (feature is new, PR #8151-era, active
area); (2) app-layer backfill bundles: on SecurejoinInviterProgress our
daemon DMs older posts to the joiner — original text carries `⚑` uuids so
the joiner's store unifies them; requires admitting author-verified
DM-carried posts into timelines + bundling for rate limits; (3) patched
core binary (fork maintenance — avoid). Long-term structural answer is
webxdc update-replay (full history for late joiners). Note: any expanded
backfill is real re-transmission on the owner's node (bandwidth, 60/min
budget), not a free outbox read like AP.

## 5. Structured payloads: JSON as extension channel, not body

Posts stay human-readable text (the vanilla-Delta-Chat interop property is
load-bearing: followers don't need deltanet, and every post degrades to a
legible message). But line-grammar markers don't scale to polls, CWs, alt
text, receipts, thread directives — so add ONE versioned JSON envelope
alongside the text rather than converting bodies:

- Carrier v1: a final `⚙ {"v":1,...}` marker line (tolerant parse like the
  other markers; keeps posts editable and quote/forward-safe).
- Carrier considered and deferred: `MessageData.html`
  (multipart/alternative — invisible to vanilla users, but HTML messages
  cannot be edited via Chat-Edit, and "show full message" chrome).
- Carrier endgame: a protected header (`Chat-Deltanet:`-style), pending
  upstream RPC support for custom headers — idiomatic per chatmail spec.

Schema discipline regardless of carrier: version field, unknown fields
must-ignore, keys never repurposed — so moving carriers is a transport
swap, not a redesign. Existing verbs (`↳re`, `♻`, `⚑`, reactions) stay as
compact human-visible markers; the envelope is for structure that doesn't
fit a line.
